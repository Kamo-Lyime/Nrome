# Practitioner Prescription Upload System - Complete Guide

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: Run SQL Scripts First**

### **Run These Scripts in Supabase SQL Editor (IN THIS ORDER):**

1. **[fix_prescription_foreign_keys.sql](fix_prescription_foreign_keys.sql)**
   - Fixes FK constraints from `user_profiles` → `auth.users`
   - Prevents "uploaded_by not in user_profiles" errors

2. **[fix_prescriptions_constraints.sql](fix_prescriptions_constraints.sql)**
   - Drops check constraints
   - Makes NOT NULL columns nullable
   - Sets defaults for timestamp columns

3. **[create_prescription_upload_function.sql](create_prescription_upload_function.sql)**
   - Creates RPC function with all required columns
   - Auto-generates prescription numbers
   - Sets `status='verified'` for practitioner uploads
   - Bypasses PostgREST schema cache issues

---

## 📊 **Prescription Status Explained**

### **Status Field (Enum):**
The `prescriptions.status` column uses these values:
- **`verified`** ← Practitioner uploads show this (GREEN badge)
- `pending_verification` (default for patient uploads)
- `rejected`
- `expired`
- `fulfilled`
- `partially_fulfilled`

### **Why "pending_verification" Was Showing:**
- The function was NOT setting the `status` column
- Database used default value: `pending_verification`
- Now fixed: Explicitly sets `status='verified'` for practitioner uploads

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Auto-Generated Fields:
| Field | Value | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `prescription_number` | `RX-YYYYMMDD-HASH` | `RX-20260627-A3F9B2C1` |
| `issue_date` | Same as `prescription_date` | `2026-06-27` |
| `valid_from` | Same as `prescription_date` | `2026-06-27` |
| `valid_until` | `prescription_expiry` or +30 days | `2026-07-27` |
| `status` | `verified` | Shows in badge |
| `verified` | `true` | Boolean flag |

patient_name              → Patient's name for easy reference

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No patients found"

**Cause:** Patient must have booked an appointment first

**Solution:**
1. Patient must book appointment with practitioner
2. Then practitioner can search for them
3. This ensures practitioners only access their own patients

### Issue: Upload button doesn't appear

**Cause:** User is not a practitioner

**Solution:**
1. Create medical practitioner profile in dashboard
2. Reload page
3. Button should appear

### Issue: Prescription doesn't appear for patient

**Cause:** Wrong `user_id` or RLS policies not updated

**Solution:**
1. Run migration SQL script
2. Verify patient's `user_id` in database
3. Check prescription was uploaded to correct patient
